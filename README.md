Machine Learning Project on YearPrediction Dataset using Various Regression Models

**Year Prediction Data Set**

The year prediction dataset is a simplified subset of the Million Song Dataset. 
This dataset has 90 attributes (features): 
12 = timbre average, 78 = timbre covariance. 

The Million Song Dataset is a collection of audio features and metadata for one million contemporary popular music tracks. The Year Prediction Dataset is a subset of this larger dataset, specifically focused on predicting the release year of songs.
The Year Prediction Dataset consists of audio features extracted from the songs, such as timbre, pitch, and other characteristics. It also includes the release year of each song. The goal of this dataset is to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict the year a song was released based on its audio features.
 
The dataset consists of 90 attributes (features) that can be categorized as follows:

Timbre Average: This category includes 12 attributes related to the average values of timbre features. Timbre features capture the tone quality and texture of a sound. Each attribute represents the average value of a specific timbre feature for a song.

Timbre Covariance: This category includes 78 attributes related to the covariance of timbre features. Covariance measures the relationship between different timbre features. Each attribute represents the covariance value between two specific timbre features for a song.
These timbre features and their covariance values provide information about the audio characteristics and their relationships in the songs.
